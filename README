SETTING UP new type styles in a new InDesign project can be tiresome. Not only setting the general design but also taking time to work on the details. Building up a full set of styles for type, tables and picture and text-objects.
So here's a first effort to make life a bit easier for you.

I have taken care to observe typographic rules and it should be helpful for beginners and pros alike.

The template is set in Times and Helvetica (you provide the actual design and layout yourself). And no adjustments have been made on the baseline grid even though all styles are aligned to the document baseline grid.
And, yes, this is just a beta version.

Have fun using it :)

How To Use:
- Open a New document in InDesign CS InDesign (v4-v6)
- From the Paragraph Styles Menu - Choose "Load All Text Styles…”
- Select the TypeTemplate document
- Uncheck the [Basic Paragraph] style and OK

To set the Table of Contents styles:
- Open "Layout / Table of Contents Styles..."
- Open Template document
- Select the "TOC Type Template" set and OK

To set the Objects styles:
- From Object Styles Menu choose "Load Object Styles..."
- Select the Type Template document
- Uncheck the styles you don't want and/or click OK


Features:
