About the typeface

I cre­a­ted this font enti­rely in the extre­mely fun and use­ful iPad app; iFont­Ma­ker. I was sur­pri­sed how easy it was to actu­ally cre­ate a new font. At the same time, how hard it is to actu­ally keep true to your own hand­wri­ting (which isn’t very sty­lish, I know).

To actu­ally make a type­face I com­bi­ned the Regu­lar and the Bold weight fonts into one file with Fon­to­grap­her. And finally I used Cufon to con­vert MyHand to a .js file for use online.
